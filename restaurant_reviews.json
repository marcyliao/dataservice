Due to the fact I used my atm card my bank won't dispute it because \"the card was physically swiped\" ...so I'm out of luck. I will never eat here again even though the food was great.

I ordered exactly that with a side of plain rice and green tea. There were a few other people in the restaurant. There is a live tank with crab and fish. Anyway my food came out and I was starving.....I noticed the veggies were old and on closer examination noticed they had that dark brown colouring on the part where the vegetable was cut which means it was not fresh! And every bite of chicken was fat! I kept spitting it out in the bowl provided for soup. After 4 bites I was completely grossed out. The rice was hard the food all together much too salty. I got up and left the food on the table as it was. The manager was called and I told her straight up \"your food is not good\". She apologized and asked why etc. I told her I couldnt believe how bad the food was the chicken was all left over parts with no meat. \u00a0She gave me 50% off I paid and I walked out.

There is no doubt that this is as authentic as it can be. Our order: Marinated Chicken Slices, Boiled Pig Intestine and Tofu in Hot Sauce, Simmered Beef Shank and Tripe with chili & spicy sauce, Boiled Beef with Bean Sprout in Hot Soup. The chicken comes to our table with its head and feet still in the plate. All the dishes are under 1/8 inch of red fragrant chili oil. There is more chili peppers in one dish here then Manchu Wok will use in an entire year. It's spicy, but not suicide wing spicy. And the liberal use Szechuan pepper corn ensures each dish is wonderfully fragrant and addictive. The taste? Fragrant chili aroma and the slight addictive numbing sensation from the Szechuan pepper corn comes together for a wonderfully delicious flavor. There is no other food culture that purposely creates a \"numb\" on the diners tongues. But you can experience that new sensation here. Not all will like it, but I am certainly hooked. There is no place like this within 30 min drive of White Rock. Frankly it seems out of place in White Rock, but since I live nearby, I'm not complaining.", "If you read Chinese, you'd see that they even have frog legs and pork blood on the menu. Why? Because that is the way people eat in Szechuan. If you think Chinese food is what you get at Manchu Wok or Panda Express, then you would be shocked and disappointed. The food here is not battered, deep fried and swimming in colorful sugary sauce (unless there's an English only menu I'm not aware of). You will not get a fortune cookie at the end of the meal.

I ordered the roti canai, chicken curry, buddha's feast and the sambal string beans w/ prawns. All i got to say is, the ONLY good thing about our dinner was the steam rice i made at home to go with the take out! The food was a total disappointment! The canai was not the authentic ones, it was greasy and most def' store bought. The sauce for it was crappy too. The Buddha's Feast is veggie dish, which i could not even eat at all. The veggies were swimming in a runny red sauce, some veggies uncooked, and some overly cooked. I def' would NOT call it a feast at all! The chicken curry was not good. Like a previous post, yes it taste just like the glico curry cubes, store bought. At last the Sambal beans and prawns were edible.... Well it tasted better then everything else, but beans were over cooked. Everything we ordered was way too saucy!!! The take out containers they used had leaked all the sauce into the bag.

My two cents.", "Update 2014: I gave this place a second chance...and while the staff that was working was very sweet I again got served hard as a rock honey almost chicken. I think it's because they mixed the new batch they made with the old stuff...and the old stuff turned really hard. I might give them a third chance...and I will ask them to NOT mix the old stuff with the new.

Both the soup and/or salad were excellent, then came the vegetable course. Choice of asparagus (steamed, served cold with a hollandaise type sauce) or grilled vegetable. The grilled vegetable was seasoned perfectly and enough for a family of four. We each then had a different entree' - filet mignon with wine sauce reduction, veal chop with mushroom sauce, cod loin, and rib steak. All were cooked perfectly and melted in your mouth - and the sauces worked perfectly! The creme brulee' was an excellent desert (though not on special menu so we were upcharged approximately 2 dollars), the other deserts were \"ok\" - but the coffee was excellent! Overall a great dinner, and 4 happy diners were more than satisfied and full! The decor and atmosphere are very well done and inviting, this establishment is very tastefully decorated to let you know you are in a professional gourmet establishment!

The sushi was prepared fresh right after we had ordered and was brought out quickly as the staff were very attentive.
